Legacy in-vehicle networks (CAN, LIN) were never designed for high-volume continuous sensor streams, leading manufacturers to adopt event-triggered and threshold-based logging. While these approaches reduce bandwidth usage, they fragment datasets and obscure subtle signals crucial for downstream ML tasks such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and perception. Modern vehicles, even with moderate ADAS adoption, generate vast, heterogeneous sensor data, creating a clear tension between data volume, logging efficiency, and ML utility. Building on this, the proposed master thesis focuses on utility-aware adaptive telemetry, where data are logged based on informational value (uncertainty or novelty), aiming to reduce bandwidth while preserving downstream ML performance. This project will implement, evaluate, and empirically validate logging policies against conventional approaches, providing a concrete, data-driven solution to the challenge highlighted by the argument chain.
