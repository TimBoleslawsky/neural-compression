\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modern vehicles generate vast amounts of data from multi-modal sensors such as cameras, radar, LiDAR, and in-vehicle networks (IVNs) like CAN and LIN.
    \item Legacy IVNs such as Classical CAN (1 Mbit/s) and LIN (20 Kbit/s) were never designed for continuous high-bandwidth streams \citep{iso11898_1_can, bello2019}.
    \item To avoid overload, event-triggered or selective logging schemes are used \citep{heemels_event_triggered_survey, tabu2007}.
    \item These reduce bandwidth but limit observability and introduce sampling bias, degrading downstream machine learning (ML) performance \citep{theissler2021, ozdemir2024}.
    \item The proliferation of ADAS and intelligent systems further multiplies data quantity and complexity \citep{adas_sensor_growth_survey, sensor_fusion_automotive}.
    \item Hence, there is a pressing need for adaptive and ML-aware logging frameworks that preserve informational value while respecting resource constraints.
\end{itemize}
