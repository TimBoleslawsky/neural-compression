\section{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main problem: Balancing Compression (neural compression and event-triggered logging) and ML Performance in Vehicular Systems!
    \item \textbf{Event-triggered diagnostics:} Threshold-based strategies miss gradual degradation patterns \citep{heemels_event_triggered_survey, obd_limitations_survey}.
    \item \textbf{Data-driven dependency:} Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and fleet analytics require dense, representative data \citep{theissler2021, mdpi2024}.
    \item \textbf{Trade-off challenge:} Compression and event-triggered sampling save bandwidth but degrade model accuracy \citep{toderici2019, bhattacharya2022, choi2023}.
    \item \textbf{Gap:} There is little systematic analysis of the rate--utility trade-off between compression efficiency and ML performance in vehicular contexts.
\end{itemize}
